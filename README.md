### WOOF ðŸ‘‹
I'm Chilldog, currently a student. Right now learning python after having some experience with C. Started Github so I can store some of my own ideas in one place and look into old projects in retrospect later. You can reach me on discord by the name of: Chilldog#1886. Have a great day!
